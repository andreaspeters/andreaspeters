### Hi there, or as we say in Northern Germany, moin. 👋

For over 27 years, I have been working in Linux system administration and backend software development. Initially for eight years as an employee, and later as a freelance consultant and self-employed professional. Over the course of my career, I have specialized in developing efficient and sustainable solutions for scalable and fault-tolerant applications. My core focus lies in the design and implementation of microservices, APIs, and distributed systems.

Throughout my professional career, I have gained extensive experience both in software development and in operating Linux servers within large-scale data centers. I combine deep technical expertise with a strong commitment to stability, performance, and maintainability.
